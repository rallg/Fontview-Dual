# Installation

You may build and install fontview-dual in Linux, or in Termux.
Entire process takes less than one minute, if you already have
the compiler and dependencies.
Since fontview-dual is a GUI program, you need a graphical desktop.

If installing into Termux:
    Executables are placed in $PREFIX/bin
    Desktop is placed in $HOME/.local/share/applications

If installing into Linux:
    Executables are placed in /usr/local/bin
    Desktop is placed in /usr/local/share/applications

If you wish to change these locations, the simplest method is to edit variables
'prefix', 'bindir', and 'datadir', near the top of file
'resource/meson.termux' or 'resource/meson.linux'. Use absolute paths.
